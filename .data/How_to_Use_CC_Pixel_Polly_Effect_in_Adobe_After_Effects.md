## Step 1: Apply CC Pixel Polly Effect
 
To apply CC Pixel Polly effect, you need to have a layer that you want to explode or shatter. You can use any type of layer, such as text, shape, image, or video. Select the layer and go to Effect > Simulation > CC Pixel Polly. You will see a preview of the effect in the Composition panel.
 
## Step 2: Adjust the Effect Settings
 
CC Pixel Polly effect has many settings that you can adjust to customize the look and behavior of the effect. Here are some of the main settings and what they do:
 
- **Force:** This controls the direction and strength of the explosion or shatter. You can use the X, Y, and Z values to change the force vector. You can also use the Force Randomness value to add some variation to the force.
- **Gravity:** This controls how much the pixels fall down after exploding or shattering. You can use the X, Y, and Z values to change the gravity vector. You can also use the Gravity Randomness value to add some variation to the gravity.
- **Grid Spacing:** This controls how big the pixels are. The smaller the grid spacing, the more pixels you will have. You can also use the Grid Spacing Randomness value to add some variation to the pixel size.
- **Scatter:** This controls how much the pixels spread out after exploding or shattering. The higher the scatter value, the more chaotic the effect will look. You can also use the Scatter Randomness value to add some variation to the scatter.
- **Spin:** This controls how much the pixels rotate after exploding or shattering. The higher the spin value, the more dynamic the effect will look. You can also use the Spin Randomness value to add some variation to the spin.
- **Color Mode:** This controls how the pixels are colored. You can choose from Original Color, Custom Color, Gradient Ramp, or None. If you choose Custom Color or Gradient Ramp, you can use the Color or Ramp settings to change the color of the pixels.
- **Completion:** This controls when and how fast the effect happens. You can use keyframes to animate this value from 0% to 100%. You can also use the Completion Speed value to change how fast the effect completes.

## Step 3: Add Some Finishing Touches
 
To make your effect more realistic and interesting, you can add some finishing touches such as motion blur, glow, or sound effects. Here are some tips on how to do that:

- **Motion Blur:** To add motion blur to your effect, you need to enable motion blur for both your layer and your composition. To do that, click on the motion blur switch for your layer and for your composition in the Timeline panel. You will see a motion blur icon next to your layer name and next to your composition name. You can also adjust the motion blur settings in the Composition Settings dialog box.
- **Glow:** To add glow to your effect, you can use another built-in effect in Adobe After Effects called Glow. To apply Glow effect, select your layer and go to Effect > Stylize > Glow. You can adjust the Glow settings such as Threshold, Radius, Intensity, and Color to change how bright and colorful your glow is.
- **Sound Effects:** To add sound effects to your effect, you need to import some sound files that match your effect. You can find some free sound effects online or create your own using a sound editing software. To import sound files, go to File > Import > File and choose your sound files. To add them to your composition, drag and drop them from the Project panel to the Timeline panel. You can trim, move, and adjust them as 0f148eb4a0
